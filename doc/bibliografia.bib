abstract = {Abstract In this review, the clinical features of Parkinson's disease, both motor and non-motor, are described in the context of the progression of the disease. Also briefly discussed are the major treatment strategies and their complications. Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorder, causing impaired motor function with slow movements, tremor and gait and balance disturbances. A variety of non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease. They include disturbed autonomic function with orthostatic hypotension, constipation and urinary disturbances, a variety of sleep disorders and a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms. This article describes the different clinical symptoms that may occur and the clinical course of the disease. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive and irreversible disease and the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In Spain, it affects around 120.000–150.000 individuals, and its prevalence is estimated to increase in the future. PD has a great impact on patients’ and caregivers’ lives and also entails a substantial socioeconomic burden. The aim of the present study was to examine the current situation and the 10-year PD forecast for Spain in order to optimize and design future management strategies. This study was performed using the modified Delphi method to try to obtain a consensus among a panel of movement disorders experts. According to the panel, future PD management will improve diagnostic capacity and follow-up, it will include multidisciplinary teams, and innovative treatments will be developed. The expansion of new technologies and studies on biomarkers will have an impact on future PD management, leading to more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and individualized therapies. However, the socio-economic impact of the disease will continue to be significant by 2030, especially for patients in advanced stages. This study highlighted the unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment and how crucial it is to establish recommendations for future diagnostic and therapeutic management of PD.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the world. Although, several CVD treatment guidelines have been developed to improve quality of care and reduce healthcare costs, for a number of reasons, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. Further, due to the extremely poor quality of data in medical patient records, most of today's healthcare IT systems cannot provide significant support to improve the quality of CVD care (particularly in chronic CVD situations which contribute to the majority of costs).We present REMIND, a Probabilistic framework for Reliable Extraction and Meaningful Inference from Nonstructured Data. REMIND integrates the structured and unstructured clinical data in patient records to automatically create high-quality structured clinical data. There are two principal factors that enable REMIND to overcome the barriers associated with inference from medical records. First, patient data is highly redundant -- exploiting this redundancy allows us to deal with the inherent errors in the data. Second, REMIND performs inference based on external medical domain knowledge to combine data from multiple sources and to enforce consistency between different medical conclusions drawn from the data -- via a probabilistic reasoning framework that overcomes the incomplete, inconsistent, and incorrect nature of data in medical patient records.This high-quality structuring allows existing patient records to be mined to support guideline compliance and to improve patient care. However, once REMIND is configured for an institution's data repository, many other important clinical applications are also enabled, including: quality assurance; therapy selection for individual patients; automated patient identification for clinical trials; data extraction for research studies; and to relate financial and clinical factors. REMIND provides value across the continuum of healthcare, ranging from small physician practice databases to the most complex hospital IT systems, from acute cardiac care to chronic CVD management, and to experimental research studies. REMIND is currently deployed across multiple disease areas over a total of 5,000,000 patients across the US.},
